# Affiliate FAQ 

#### What happens to my information once I fill out the verification form?
Unfortunately, for verification purposes, your email and possibly other PII (personally identifiable information) is required. Rest assured, though, that this information is only known to the moderation team. Each member of the moderation team takes great care to protect your information. Your email and any other PII we collect will not be released to anyone outside the moderation team, including the university. The information is purely for verification purposes, and, as a team, we tend to look at your email extension (`@g.harvard.edu`, `@college.harvard.edu`) far more than the actual email address.

#### I have a partner or close friend I want to invite to the server as a regular. Can I? 
Though it is on the rarer side, we do allow students and affiliates to bring in friends and/or partners as regulars. Life happens, though, and friends and partners tend to have falling-outs. To minimize how frequently we must add and remove regulars, we do not approve these requests too frequently. Please reach out to a moderator to have your request evaluated. Note that this does not apply to regulars, and only Harvard affiliates can request partners and friends to be given the `@Regular` role.

#### Another affiliate or verified member has made me uncomfortable. What do I do? 
Please screenshot the messages that made you uncomfortable and contact a moderator immediately. If the interaction was over a voice chat, please notify a moderator of what occurred. If you feel comfortable doing so, you may disclose your username to the entire moderation team, or you can ask the moderator you file the complaint with to maintain your confidentiality. We take these reports incredibly seriously, and we will act as quickly as possible to prevent future incidents from occurring. Though we have immense confidence in the integrity of our moderation team, if a member of the team makes you uncomfortable in any way, shape, or form, please reach out to another trusted moderator and will handle the situation immediately. 

#### Someone from the public channels is PMing me without my permission. What do I do? 
Please notify a moderator ASAP. The person will be warned and, on subsequent infractions, banned. 

#### I have a student organization or opportunity that I would like to advertise. Do I need prior moderator approval?
No! Simply fill out the opportunity form linked in the pins in `#resources` and it will automatically post your listing to students. If you want to advertise services or other things to members of the public channels, though, please reach out to a moderator for permission. 

#### There's someone in the public channels I really like, and I think they should be given the Regular role. How do I nominate them?
Simply head to `#suggestions` and suggest that they be given the `@Regular` role. If enough students agree, and if the moderation team sees that they have enough activity and history on the server, they will be given the role! 

#### I head a student organization or officially recognized group, and I want to have my group based out of the Discord. Is this possible?
In short, yes! The Minecraft Club was founded on the Harvard server and soon became official because of its positive reception on the server. Please reach out to a moderator with details explaining your organization, why you want to use our platform for communication, what resources you need, etc., and the moderation team will evaluate your request.
