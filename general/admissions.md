# Admissions FAQ
While HCom is not an admissions help server, we do often get questions about admissions from folks in the public channels. In order to limit repetition, we've compiled some of our commonly asked questions about admissions here. 

#### Will a recommendation from a Harvard professor, alumnus, etc. help me get in? 
In short, it depends. If that particular person knows you well and will write you a compelling letter of recommendation, then yes, it will help! If they are a Harvard affiliate who does not know you well, then they likely will not write a compelling rec, which will only harm your application. In short, choose the person over the prestige. Your recommendations should come from teachers who know you well and are ethusiastic about recommending you to colleges. Anything less will hurt your application more than it will help it.

#### What extracurriculars should I do to bolster my chances of acceptance? 
Any! Though Harvard is obviously keen on some sports, such as tennis and rowing and such, your ECs should revolve around the things you love. In interviews and essays, they will not ask WHICH ECs you do; rather, they will ask WHY you do the ECs that you do. Your motive and dedication to an activity matter far, far more than what activities you do. 

#### My family is low-income. How will this impact my application? 
It shouldn't impact your application at all. Harvard is need-blind, meaning they review your application as separate to your need for financial aid. Needing more or less financial aid should not impact the college's decision on your entry. 

#### Can you read/review my common application or essay?  
Most likely not. You are welcome to ask students if they are willing to, but the answer is almost always no. Some students may agree to this at a fee, since they are private tutors. You are welcome to ask in `#prospective-students` if there are any private tutors in the server who would be willing to take you as a student for essay reviews and such.

#### What ACT or SAT scores and GPA do I need to get in? 
Harvard often boasts about their holistic application process, meaning that your ACT/SAT scores or GPA are not the only factors they take into account when reviewing your application. Nonetheless, these things are widely available online. Try [prepscholar](https://www.prepscholar.com/sat/s/colleges/Harvard-admission-requirements). 

#### Can you share your stats? 
No. The answer is always no. We are not an admissions server, and students are discouraged from sending their ACT/SAT scores, GPA, and extracurriculars. Please do not ask.
